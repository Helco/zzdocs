## fb0x06
Last but not least the sixth database file which stores all of the dialog text along with a refernce to the NPC it belongs and optionally a voice column which is not used at all.

### Columns

| Idx | Name | Description |
|:---:|------|-------------|
|  0  | Text | A string containing the dialog text |
|  1  | Npc  | A foreign key UID to [[fb0x05|fb0x05]] to the NPC it belongs to, is not always valid (as there unused lines) |
|  2  | Voice | This column is always empty and thus can be ignored |
