## Scene section "Backdrop"

This section is composed out of a single *zstring*, which sometimes is a backdrop model which is then used as a static background. <br/>
If however this string has a underscore ```_```, there is a number to the left of said underscore which is used by the game to add a hardcoded dynamic background.
To the right of the underscore there is a short description of the background which is ignored by the game.
