## RWCollisionPLG (0x011D)

The RWCollisionPLG section should obviously store collision data and can be found as [[RWExtension|RWExtension]] childs of [RWAtomicSection]()s.

Unfortunately neither the GTA community nor kabbi bothered to decrypt this format, so this is an important task I have to do...
