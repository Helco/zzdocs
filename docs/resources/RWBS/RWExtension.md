# RWExtension (0x0003)

Extension sections are the only list section without a meaningful [[RWStruct]] child section attached to it. It is used to store sections by RenderWare plugins and thus can be found in many common list sections.

## Possible child sections

* [[RWAnimationPLG]]
* [[RWBinMeshPLG]]
* [[RWCollisionPLG]]
* [[RWMorphPLG]]
* [[RWSkinPLG]]
