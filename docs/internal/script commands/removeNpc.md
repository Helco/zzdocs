# removeNpc

The script command `removeNpc` takes no parameter, its short form is `-`. It adds a new [GSModDisableTrigger](../../resources/DAT.md#gsmoddisabletrigger) to the scene to persist the removing and then removes itselfs from the world. As it can be executed in implementation 1 as well as 3 it may also close the current dialog.
