### Contributing to this wiki

This wiki is created using the wiki software [Gollum](https://github.com/gollum/gollum), but there are some modifications made to the software as to make it more compatible with the Github Wiki and to ease the navigation:

- Anchor links are Github Style __not__ Gollum Style: If you have a headline ```A * B?``` on a site ```Page```  the link to this section would be ```Page#A---B-```. For more examples see the official Github Wiki Manual
- Contrary to the first point, links to other pages on this wiki are Gollum Style ( in the form of ```[[Link-Text|URL]]```), links to external resources are Github Style ( ```[Link-Text](URL)```). This is because Gollum links work in Github, but not the other way around.

Furthermore this wiki is structured in folders and subfolders, please do not use the Github Wiki Editor if you are creating a new file. Instead clone the [wiki repository](https://github.com/Helco/zzkb.wiki.git) and create the file in the right directory.
