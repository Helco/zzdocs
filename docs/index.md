This is the home of the ZanZarah Knowledge Base, a project to gather as much (focus on technical) information as possible about the rather old PC-Game ZanZarah: The Hidden Portal made by Funatics Entertainment and originally released 2002 by THQ.

The non-plus ultra consequence would be the recreation of the ZanZarah executable.

## Structure

This wiki is first of all structured in four sections:

- _Resources_ contain information about the fileformats and content
- _Internal_ contain information about how the game behaves
- _Gameplay_ contain information about what the player sees and interacts with
- _Tools_ contain information about the tools created for this project
